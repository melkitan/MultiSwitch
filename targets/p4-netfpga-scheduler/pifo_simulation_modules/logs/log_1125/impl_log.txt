LUTLP-1#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
3 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is nf_datapath_0/scheduler_top_1/output_queue_inst_port0/addr_manager_inst/r_buffer_rd_addr_next[0]. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: nf_datapath_0/scheduler_top_1/output_queue_inst_port0/addr_manager_inst/buffer_pkt_inst_i_314, nf_datapath_0/scheduler_top_1/output_queue_inst_port0/buffer_wrapper_inst/buffer_pkt_inst_i_348, nf_datapath_0/scheduler_top_1/output_queue_inst_port0/addr_manager_inst/r_fl_tail[0]_i_1.

4 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is nf_datapath_0/scheduler_top_1/output_queue_inst_port4/addr_manager_inst/r_buffer_rd_addr_next[0]. Please evaluate your design.

This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation.

Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (nf_datapath_0/nf_sume_sdnet_wrapper_1/inst/SimpleSumeSwitch_inst/S_SYNCER_for_TopDeparser/af8af7uc1n5kj4s69mi85uq7iky34_1094/gnuram_async_fifo.xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg_2) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design.

This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation.

writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (nf_datapath_0/nf_sume_sdnet_wrapper_1/inst/SimpleSumeSwitch_inst/TopDeparser/TopDeparser_t_inst/stage_2/editor_inst/PktFifo_inst/RAM/RAM_reg_2) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
